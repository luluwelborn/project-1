### Wireframe (need to recreate):

### My Game Outline
Keep Falling Asleep. Avoid obstacles by moving left and right, otherwise you will wake up and have to start over. The more obstacles you can avoid, the higher your score!

As obstacle objects animate into the game area, the user will press left or right to avoid them, if the collide, the user will lose and the game will be reset. I plan to have a landing page, game page, and win page.

See the wireframe sketch, wireframe.jpg, in my main project-1/assets folder.

### Technologies used
I used jQuery and css animations to create my game. JS/jQuery was used to move the player left and right, and css animations were used to move the obtacles.

### Unsolved Problems
Tech - I was unable to create a "win" state for my game, and was unsussesful in adding a successful score timer. I had also hoped to have time to make "lose" and "win" screens, which I did not.

I also had trouble controling the speed of the animation, I have what I believe to be the correct code to keep the animation the same speed but it's not working for me. I also can't find how to hide my div objects until the reach 400px below the gameboard.

Visuals - I put visuals aside to work on functionality, so the game is not as visually pleasing as I had hoped, that inclues having basic shapes as characters rather than images.

### 7/12 First Outline
Avoid obstacles by moving up and down. If you can avoid all the obstacles in your way by the time you reach your destination, you win!

My plan for this game is to have a background image that animates/moves left until a certain point, and repeats. This will give my main object (a ghost in the wireframe) the appearance that it is moving to the right. As obstacle objects animate into the game area, the user will press up or down to avoid the obstacles, otherwise the user will lose. I plan to have a landing page, game page, pause page, and win page. I will brainstorm a little more to develop the story and the characters, but I want to get the js working first.

### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** – since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!


---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Include** two players (either two humans, or human and computer)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** *or* **jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Self-scoring Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** _(a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)_
* **[jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com)** _(if you're using jQuery)_
* **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
